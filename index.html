        <p>
          I'm a Sophomore Computer Science major at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, and I'm Interested in
          developing Database systems and Web development. 
          I've worked on a few projects that have introduced me to these topics and I am eager to learn more and 
          contribute to existing projects to improve their functionality and expand their features.
        </p>

          This site is where I want to showcase who I am and
          some of my favorite projects I have worked on to give everyone a look
          into who I am and what I like to do!
